## Descriptions

This application utilizes user inputs to generate a team of employees and ultimately publishes an html file. When the app is initiated the user is prompted questions about the manger of the team. The user then has the option to add additional employees (an engineer or intern) or finish creating a team. If the later is chosen the a webpage with cards of each member of the team will be displayed.
